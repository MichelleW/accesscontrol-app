💡 What You Can Improve for Next Time

🔧 Technical
Implement playback animation if a play icon is shown — it's usually expected.
Enhance the timeline UX:
Use real thumbnails or hover previews
Highlight the scrubbed frame visually
Match the layout more closely to the provided mockup:
Spacing
Positioning of controls
Proportions
🎯 Product Thinking
Think like the end user:
"Would this feel like a timeline I can scrub through like a security video?"
Prioritize function first, polish second — but get at least the core flow working.
⏱️ Interview Tactic
If running out of time, leave a note or comment like:
// Next: Implement setInterval logic for playback
// Consider: Thumbnails on hover for scrub bar markers
This shows senior-level foresight even if time is tight.
